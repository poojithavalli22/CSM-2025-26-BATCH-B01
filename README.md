## 🌍 Overview  

Biofloc technology enhances **sustainable aquaculture** by recycling nutrients and minimizing water usage.  
However, even small fluctuations in water parameters can cause:  
- High fish mortality 🐠  
- Reduced yields 📉  
- Financial losses 💸  

This system provides a **reliable IoT-based solution** with:  
- Continuous **real-time monitoring** of water quality.  
- **ML-based predictions** of risks.  
- **Alerts** to keep farmers informed.  
- A **hybrid monitoring layer** for reliability.
