Smart Biofloc Aquaculture: ML Predictions with IoT-Based Monitoring and Alerts
Overview

Biofloc technology enhances sustainable aquaculture by recycling nutrients and minimizing water usage. However, small fluctuations in water quality can cause high fish mortality and financial losses. This project provides a cost-effective IoT solution to continuously monitor water parameters, predict risks using machine learning, and send alerts to farmers.

The system integrates real-time monitoring, ML-based predictions, and a hybrid monitoring layer for reliability. SMS notifications ensure farmers are informed.
